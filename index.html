                      <p class="lead my-3">Whales, descendants of land mammals, evolved around 54 million years ago into two main groups: baleen whales, which filter feed using baleen plates, and toothed whales, equipped with teeth for hunting. They breathe air through blowholes and display a vast size range, from dwarf sperm whales to the massive blue whale. Baleen whales filter krill and plankton, while toothed whales hunt fish and squid. They communicate through diverse vocalizations and undertake extensive migrations for feeding and breeding. Once heavily hunted, whales are now protected, facing threats like bycatch and pollution. Their cultural significance spans diverse cultures worldwide, celebrated through activities like whale watching. Despite conservation efforts, ongoing challenges persist, highlighting the need for continued protection and stewardship of these magnificent marine mammals.</p>

                            <p class="lead my-3">The word "whale" comes from the Old English hw√¶l, from Proto-Germanic *hwalaz, from Proto-Indo-European *(s)kwal-o-, meaning "large sea fish". The Proto-Germanic *hwalaz is also the source of Old Saxon hwal, Old Norse hvalr, hvalfiskr, Swedish val, Middle Dutch wal, walvisc, Dutch walvis, Old High German wal, and German Wal. Other archaic English forms include wal, wale, whal, whalle, whaille, wheal, etc.</p>

                            <p class="lead my-3">The term "whale" is sometimes used interchangeably with dolphins and porpoises, acting as a synonym for Cetacea. Six species of dolphins have the word "whale" in their name, collectively known as blackfish: the orca, or killer whale, the melon-headed whale, the pygmy killer whale, the false killer whale, and the two species of pilot whales, all of which are classified under the family Delphinidae (oceanic dolphins). Each species has a different reason for it, for example, the killer whale was named "Ballena asesina" 'killer whale' by Spanish sailors.

                            <p class="lead my-3">The anatomy of whales is finely tuned to their marine environment. With torpedo-shaped bodies, flippers, and tail fins, they move swiftly through the water. Whales lack external ear flaps and have flattened heads with small eye orbits. They range greatly in size, from the 2.6-meter dwarf sperm whale to the 34-meter blue whale, the largest creature on Earth. Baleen whales have large whalebone plates for filter feeding, while toothed whales possess conical teeth. Both types have blowholes for breathing air, with baleen whales having two and toothed whales having one.</p>

                            <p class="lead my-3">Breathing involves exhaling stale air in a steamy spout before inhaling fresh air. All whales are insulated by a thick layer of blubber, vital for buoyancy, protection, and energy storage. They have specialized stomachs and rely on their tail fins for propulsion. Whales are adapted for diving to great depths, with physiological mechanisms to conserve oxygen and withstand water pressure.</p>

                            <p class="lead my-3">Whales exhibit diverse feeding behaviors depending on their species and size. Odontocetes, such as dolphins and sperm whales, primarily consume fish, cephalopods, and occasionally crustaceans and bivalves. Mysticetes, like the blue whale and minke whale, predominantly feed on krill and plankton, supplemented by crustaceans and other invertebrates. Baleen whales use their elaborate baleen plates to filter out water while retaining planktonic food.
                            <br/>
                            While most whales hunt alone, some species engage in cooperative hunting, especially when prey is abundant. Large whales, like mysticetes, are generally not preyed upon, but smaller species, such as monodontids and ziphiids, face predation from orcas. Orcas employ strategic tactics, including ramming and corralling, to hunt smaller whales, particularly calves. Additionally, polar bears are adept at hunting Arctic whales and their calves, using both stealthy and aggressive approaches on ice or in water. Whales mitigate predation risks by gathering in groups, though this can also present challenges, especially as sea ice closes in around breathing holes. Overall, predation plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of whale populations, influencing their behavior and distribution in marine environments.</p>

                            <p class="lead my-3">A 2010 study considered whales to be a positive influence to the productivity of ocean fisheries, in what has been termed a "whale pump." Whales carry nutrients such as nitrogen from the depths back to the surface. This functions as an upward biological pump, reversing an earlier presumption that whales accelerate the loss of nutrients to the bottom. This nitrogen input in the Gulf of Maine is "more than the input of all rivers combined" emptying into the gulf, some 23,000 metric tons (25,000 short tons) each year. Whales defecate at the ocean's surface; their excrement is important for fisheries because it is rich in iron and nitrogen. The whale faeces are liquid and instead of sinking, they stay at the surface where phytoplankton feed off it.</p>

                            <p class="lead my-3">Upon death, whale carcasses fall to the deep ocean and provide a substantial habitat for marine life. Evidence of whale falls in present-day and fossil records shows that deep sea whale falls support a rich assemblage of creatures, with a global diversity of 407 species, comparable to other neritic biodiversity hotspots, such as cold seeps and hydrothermal vents.

                            Deterioration of whale carcasses happens though a series of three stages. Initially, moving organisms such as sharks and hagfish, scavenge the soft tissues at a rapid rate over a period of months, and as long as two years. This is followed by the colonization of bones and surrounding sediments (which contain organic matter) by enrichment opportunists, such as crustaceans and polychaetes, throughout a period of years. Finally, sulfophilic bacteria reduce the bones releasing hydrogen sulfide enabling the growth of chemoautotrophic organisms, which in turn, support other organisms such as mussels, clams, limpets, and sea snails. This stage may last for decades and supports a rich assemblage of species, averaging 185 species per site.</p>
